**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This app provides the visitor with an easy way to find book information using google's Books API. It queries that API using the user's input then returns title, author, description, and an image of the top 10 results.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Set up the server framework.
2. Install the necessary dependencies on your machine (express, superagent, and ejs).
3. Create a route that handles the API call and responds with the results you want, in the model you want.
4. Create EJS templates to render your results on a new page.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
